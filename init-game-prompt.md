# Initialize Your Multiplayer Game

You are running this prompt against **`zz-template-smoke`** — a working multiplayer
game TEMPLATE whose game definition is **DEFERRED**. Connect / reconnect / identity, the
lobby, rooms, the 60 Hz broadcast loop, MCP game-state visibility, and ha-router
integration ALL work today against a placeholder **echo** game.

Your job in this session is **NOT to write game code yet**. It is to:

1. Read this prompt and the wiring notes below so you understand every extension point.
2. **Interview the user** with the focused questions in the "Interview" section.
3. Once every question is answered, **GENERATE the file `init-game.md`** — a concrete,
   build-ready prompt (exact file paths, exact code blocks, ordered edits) that a build
   team will later execute verbatim to turn this template into the user's actual game.

A skeleton of the artifact you will produce already exists at `init-game.md` (filled with
`<PLACEHOLDERS>` and one illustrative example). You will OVERWRITE it with the concrete,
user-specific version. Do not start editing template source files in this session.

> **Build environment — assume you are INSIDE the devcontainer.** This prompt and every
> prompt it generates run inside the devcontainer (`./dev-container.sh` from the host opens
> it). All dependency installs (`pnpm install`, `./run.sh --install`) and all commands
> (`./validate.sh`, `./run.sh`) happen INSIDE the container — never install on the host.
> System tools belong in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, project deps in the workspace via pnpm.

## Where this fits in the process

`new-game.sh` already: registered the game in ha-router, built the devcontainer, verified the
public URL, and seeded GitHub with the **groundwork epics** (devcontainer verified, tooling/MCP,
team, quality gates, testing foundations, design, architecture/build plan) plus the project board
and branch ruleset. Your output — `init-game.md` and the design docs it needs — is the work of the
"Game design" and "Architecture and build plan" epics; file game-specific design tickets under
the design epic as the interview reveals them. Follow **`WORKFLOW.md`** for tickets, the board,
the waiting-on-human rule, and the PR/review rules. **Epics scope one phase of groundwork, never
the whole game** — later build phases go in the roadmap issue until the user approves them.

## How the template is wired (READ before interviewing)

- **One Fastify server on port 4420** serves `/api` + `/ws` + `/debug-mcp`. The Angular
  client runs on **4422** and proxies those three paths to 4420 (`packages/client/proxy.conf.json`).
- **Standards (READ and enforce):** `ENGINEERING.md` (the `./validate.sh all` gate, testing,
  TS/lint, architecture, Definition of Done), `ASSET-GENERATION.md` (the code-drawn visual
  quality bar), and `AUDIO-PIPELINE.md` (the opt-in Google-default audio pipeline). Every edit
  `init-game.md` prescribes must comply with these; the generated build plan must reference them.
- **Generic message envelope** lives in `packages/shared/src/types/messages.ts`:
  - Client → Server gameplay verb: `player_input { type:'player_input', payload: GameInput }`.
  - Server → Client gameplay verb: `game_snapshot { type:'game_snapshot', snapshot: GameSnapshot }`.
  - Lobby verbs (`join_lobby`, `update_player_info`, `create_game`, `join_game`,
    `start_game`, `delete_game`, `client_performance`) and lobby responses
    (`lobby_update`, `game_started`, `game_state`, `player_joined`, `player_disconnected`,
    `error`) already work — leave them alone unless the game needs new lobby fields.
  - `GameInput`, `GameSnapshot`, and `GameSessionConfig` are the **only** game-defined
    types. They are currently `unknown` / `{ maxPlayers }` TODO hooks.
- **The ONE server game seam** is `packages/server/src/game/game-module.ts`. It defines the
  `GameModule` interface (`submitInput` / `reduceGameState` / `serializeRoomState` /
  `addPlayer` / `removePlayer` / optional `free`) and a `GameModuleFactory`.
  `defaultGameModuleFactory` is a trust-client **echo** (stores latest input per player,
  echoes `{ players: { [pid]: lastInput } }`). `packages/server/src/index.ts` wires it in.
- **The room loop** lives in `packages/server/src/lobby/game-room.ts`. It calls the three
  `GameModule` hooks each tick: `reduceGameState()` → `serializeRoomState()` → broadcast
  `game_snapshot`. All connection / late-join / disconnect-grace / reattach plumbing is
  generic and done — game logic only touches the `GameModule`.
- **Lobby/room lifecycle** lives in `packages/server/src/lobby/lobby-manager.ts` (created
  with a `GameModuleFactory`). `onPlayerInput` forwards to `room.submitInput`.
- **The message validation seam** is `packages/server/src/ws/message-schemas.ts`. The
  `player_input` payload is `z.unknown()` (local-only, we trust the client) and
  `create_game.config` has a `passthrough()` with a `maxPlayers` field — both marked TODO.
  Add new client verbs in `message-router.ts` / `message-schemas.ts` if (and only if) the
  game needs them.
- **MCP game-state seam:** `packages/server/src/mcp/debug-context.ts` exposes an optional
  `getRoomGameState(gameId): unknown`. The MCP tool `debug_get_game_state`
  (`packages/server/src/mcp/handlers/game-state.ts`) returns whatever it yields, or a
  "not wired yet" note. Other MCP tools (`debug_get_connections`, `debug_list_games`,
  `debug_get_room`, `debug_get_performance`, `debug_get_room_performance`) are generic and
  already work. Add game-specific tools as new files under `packages/server/src/mcp/handlers/`.
- **The ONE client game seam** is `packages/client/src/app/game/game-setup.ts`
  (`setupGame({ send, messages$, drainLatestSnapshot })`) — the entire game loop +
  renderer goes here. Supporting client pieces:
  - `packages/client/src/app/services/websocket.service.ts` — WS transport, reconnect,
    outbound queue, `drainLatestSnapshot()` snapshot-coalescing fast path (do not touch).
  - `packages/client/src/app/services/identity.service.ts` — stable `zz-template-smoke.clientId`.
  - `packages/client/src/app/services/multiplayer.service.ts` — generic signal state
    (`connected`, `phase`, `playerId`, `gameId`, `playerIds`, `games`, `sessionConfig`,
    `snapshot`) plus the lobby/input send methods; snapshot/config handling is TODO.
  - `packages/client/src/app/app.component.ts` — stub lobby UI (connect / create / join /
    start / delete + snapshot JSON view); the `create_game` config payload (`createGame()`)
    is a TODO. This is the host component where the real game view mounts `setupGame()`.
- **Trust model: LOCAL-ONLY.** Default is to trust the client wholesale; there is no
  anti-cheat. Prefer simplicity. Only the few values the server must own (score, lives,
  win/lose, collisions) get computed in `reduceGameState` and merged into the snapshot.
- **No persistence, no physics engine, no `@fastify/static`.** Add persistence only if the
  game truly needs saved state.
- **ha-router integration deliverables** are pre-authored under `ha-router/`:
  - `route.template.yml` — Traefik 3-router template (`<slug>`-api / -ws / client),
    single backend on 4420 for `/api`+`/ws`+`/debug-mcp`, client on 4422.
  - `landing-card.html` — a landing-page game-card snippet.
  - `HA-ROUTER.md` — how to copy these into the real `ha-router` repo.

## DEFERRED REQUIREMENTS you must resolve (the 12-item list)

These are the decisions the template intentionally left open. Your interview must resolve
ALL of them, and `init-game.md` must make each concrete.

1. **Identity** — game name, one-line theme/concept, URL slug, display title, landing-card
   icon hue.
2. **Ports** — **already chosen for you; do NOT pick or re-verify them.** `new-game.sh`
   selected a free pair on the host (checked against the live `ha-router` config the container
   can't see) and recorded it in **`PORTS.env`** (`SERVER_PORT`/`CLIENT_PORT`/`SLUG`) — read
   that file and use those values. They're already baked into the eight integration files;
   just confirm those files agree with `PORTS.env`. Use the slug + ports to _prepare_ the
   ha-router route YAML + landing card (see Identity for the icon hue).
3. **Player model** — max players; avatars (indexed 0–5) vs named characters; teams/roles.
4. **Tick model** — real-time fixed-tick (keep 60 Hz `game_snapshot`) vs turn-based
   (lower / event-driven broadcast).
5. **`GameInput` shape** — what a player sends each tick/turn
   (`message-schemas.ts` payload schema + `messages.ts GameInput`).
6. **`GameSnapshot` + `GameSessionConfig` shapes** — what clients render each tick, and
   the per-session create-time config (`messages.ts`, `createGameSchema.config`).
7. **Client-trust boundary** — default = trust client wholesale (local-only). Identify any
   server-authoritative values computed in `reduceGameState` and merged into the snapshot.
8. **Server `GameModule` impl** — `submitInput` / `reduceGameState` / `serializeRoomState`
   / `add`/`removePlayer` (`game-module.ts`), and wire the real factory into `index.ts`.
9. **Persistence** — none by default; specify what + where only if the game needs it.
10. **MCP game-state visibility** — implement `getRoomGameState(gameId)` and wire it into
    the `DebugContext` in `index.ts`; optionally add game-specific MCP tools.
11. **Client rendering** — the `game/game-setup.ts` loop + renderer (canvas/DOM/Pixi/etc.),
    and the `app.component.ts` `create_game` config payload.
12. **Session config fields** — the `createGameSchema.config` TODO (beyond `maxPlayers`).

## Interview — ASK THESE QUESTIONS (group sensibly; do NOT generate until answered)

Ask conversationally; you may group related questions. Do not proceed to generation until
every item below has an answer (mark any "use the default" answers explicitly).

**A. Identity & hosting**

1. Game name, one-line theme/concept, URL slug, and display title?
2. Ports: do NOT ask the user — they're pre-selected in `PORTS.env` (`SERVER_PORT`/`CLIENT_PORT`/`SLUG`);
   read them. Just confirm the slug from `PORTS.env` for the ha-router host
   `<slug>.preffect-ha.preffect-home.net`. The only thing to ask here is the landing-card icon
   hue (hex, e.g. lime `#a3e635`).

**B. Players & session** 3. Player model: max players? Indexed avatars (0–5) or named characters? Any teams/roles? 4. What lives in the per-game session CONFIG at create time, beyond `maxPlayers`
(seed, mode, map, difficulty, round count)? 5. Win/lose / round / level structure? Is late-join allowed (the template supports it)?

**C. Tick & networking** 6. Real-time (fixed-tick) or turn-based? If real-time, is 60 Hz right or should the
broadcast be slower? If turn-based, what event triggers a broadcast? 7. What is a player's INPUT each tick/turn? (exact fields → `GameInput`) 8. What is the SHARED GAME STATE clients render each tick? (exact fields → `GameSnapshot`)

**D. Authority & persistence** 9. Authority: anything the SERVER must own (score, lives, win/lose, collisions, spawn)?
Or pure client-trust? (Default: trust the client wholesale.) 10. Persistence: must any state survive a restart? If so, what and where?

**E. Rendering & MCP** 11. Rendering approach: HTML canvas/2D, plain DOM, Pixi, Three.js, text? Any existing
assets or art direction? 12. MCP: which game-state details should Claude be able to inspect via
`debug_get_game_state`? Any extra game-specific MCP tools (entities, tiles, scores)?

---

## After answers — GENERATE `init-game.md`

Overwrite `init-game.md` with a concrete, build-ready prompt using this structure. Use
exact file paths and real code blocks (no open questions, no `<PLACEHOLDERS>` left). A
build team will execute it verbatim.

### 1. Game Definition

Name, theme, slug, display title, ports, icon hue, player model, tick model, win/lose,
late-join policy, persistence decision, trust boundary.

### 2. Shared type edits — `packages/shared/src/types/messages.ts`

Exact `GameInput` interface, exact `GameSnapshot` interface, exact `GameSessionConfig`
fields (replacing the `unknown` / `{ maxPlayers }` TODO hooks). Add constants to
`packages/shared/src/index.ts` if needed.

### 3. Server edits

- `packages/server/src/ws/message-schemas.ts` — replace `playerInputSchema` payload
  `z.unknown()` with the real input schema; add fields to `createGameSchema.config`.
- `packages/server/src/ws/message-router.ts` — add new client message cases only if needed.
- `packages/server/src/game/game-module.ts` — full `GameModule` impl + factory (the game
  tick logic), replacing `defaultGameModuleFactory`.
- `packages/server/src/index.ts` — import the real factory; wire `getRoomGameState` into
  the MCP `DebugContext`.
- `packages/server/src/mcp/handlers/*` — any new game-specific MCP tools.
- `packages/server/src/lobby/game-room.ts` / `lobby-manager.ts` — only if the game needs
  hooks beyond the existing seams (usually untouched).

### 4. Client edits

- `packages/client/src/app/game/game-setup.ts` — implement `setupGame({ send, messages$,
drainLatestSnapshot, host? })`: an input loop calling `send(gameInput)` (wraps
  `player_input`) + a `drainLatestSnapshot()` render loop + renderer for the chosen approach.
- `packages/client/src/app/services/multiplayer.service.ts` — snapshot/state signals and any
  new lobby/input send methods.
- `packages/client/src/app/app.component.ts` — real `create_game` config payload
  (`createGame()`), lobby UI, and mounting the game view via `setupGame`.

### 5. Ports & config

The ports come from `PORTS.env` (`SERVER_PORT`/`CLIENT_PORT`/`SLUG`) — do NOT change them.
Verify they are consistent across `packages/server/src/index.ts`,
`packages/client/angular.json`, `packages/client/proxy.conf.json`,
`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, `dev-container.sh`, `run.sh`, `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`
(they should already match, baked in by `presetup.sh`; state "no change" if so, otherwise fix
toward `PORTS.env`).

### 6. ha-router integration

> **The container CANNOT edit the live `ha-router` repo (it isn't mounted).** So only _prepare_
> the artifacts in THIS repo: a filled-in route file `ha-router/<slug>.yml` (from
> `ha-router/route.template.yml`, slug + ports from `PORTS.env`) and a filled-in
> `ha-router/landing-card.html` (slug, display title, icon hue). Do not touch
> `/home/preffect/source/ha-router`.

Then, as the **final action of the session**, emit the copy-paste **hand-off prompt for the
host AI** exactly as specified in `ha-router/HA-ROUTER.md` **Step 6** (with `<slug>` /
`<server-port>` / `<client-port>` substituted from `PORTS.env`), so the user can pass it to
the host AI to apply the route + landing card and verify the live URL.

### 7. Verification

Run everything INSIDE the devcontainer (open it from the host with `./dev-container.sh`):
`pnpm install`; `./validate.sh all`; `./run.sh`; open two browser tabs on the client port;
confirm the lobby → create → join → start → snapshot flow; send `player_input` and observe
`game_snapshot`; query `debug_get_game_state` via the `zz-template-smoke-debug` MCP server.

Additionally, the generated `init-game.md` MUST instruct the build team to:

- treat **`ENGINEERING.md`** as binding: extract game logic into pure functions with unit tests
  (happy/edge/error), add `*.integration.test.ts` for input→reduce→snapshot and lobby→room→
  broadcast wiring, validate every new WS verb in `message-schemas.ts`, and make
  **`./validate.sh all` green** with the **Definition of Done** satisfied before declaring done;
- meet **`ASSET-GENERATION.md`**'s per-asset checklist for every visual asset in
  `game-setup.ts` (layered, shaded, palette-named, animated, silhouette-legible — no flat
  rectangles);
- if the game has audio, stand up **`AUDIO-PIPELINE.md`** (`ai-pipeline.sh` + `tools/` + the
  `.env.example` keys, Google/Gemini default) and leave `./ai-pipeline.sh check` clean — never
  running `sync` unsolicited.

---

Emit `init-game.md` as concrete, build-ready instructions. Do not write any template source
code in this session — only interview and produce `init-game.md`.
